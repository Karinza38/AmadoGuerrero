 ### Welcome to the Real World

I have been coding since I was 12 (started off with Vanilla JS back in 2005).
I wanted to be a hacker when I was younger (I blame The Matrix) so I know my way around Linux and have an arguably decent understanding of Cybersecurity, Assembly Language, and Networking.

Skills:
- HTML/CSS/JS/TS
- TypeORM/Knex
- Node/Express
- APIs/REST
- SQL/MySQL/NoSQL
- Redux/Context
- React/Next.js/Redux/React Native
- PHP/WP/Laravel
- Python/Go
- Linux
- Java/C++/OOP

My hobbies include:
- Coding (duh)
- Electronics (Arduinos, Microcontrollers, etc.)
- Woodworking
- Playing Tennis (I used to teach it when I was younger)
